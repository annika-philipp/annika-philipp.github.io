                <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
                <p>
                    Self awareness is the same as mindfulness in the sense that both allow us to reflect on or take note
                    off our emotions, mental and/or physical state in the present moment. Both are done in a non-judgemental/neutral way 
                    and both are learnable and definitely get easier the more we practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did the Journaling for Self-Assement with the prompts suggested in the book. This was a fairly easy task
                    although I surprised myself with some of the things I came up with especially when there was still time left
                    and I started to reflect a lot deeper.
                <p>

                <h4>What did I take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>
                <p>
                    That emotion are what I feel not who I am. I imagine that saying 'I feel stressed' instead of saying 'I am stressed' could 
                    also in the long run have positive effects on how my body copes with stress.
