        <h4>Getting blocked on a simple problem and solving it</h4>
        <p>
            That time when I wrote one of my previous blog posts, saved the post file, updated my index file and index image, 
            pushed to GitHub to make it live - and nothing happened. No update. Nothing. I kept hitting the refresh button 
            (repeatedly and more and more forcefully), cursing the slow internet which in my mind meant that my updates hadn't 
            been received (because if in doubt look for the fault in anything but your own actions right?). I even checked my file 
            on GitHub which seemed to confirm that all fault was with the internet... until I eventually noticed that the new blog
            post was still set in comments... Everything was there, I just hadn't uncommented it. I'm expecting more moments like this
            over the next few months, missing semi-colons, quotation marks, wrong brackets, you name it. Lesson learnt: pay attention 
            to details in my own code.
        </p>
        <h4>Getting blocked on a simple problem and solving it in an elegant way</h4>
        <p>
            That other time when... well let's be honest almost every time this week. There have been some moments when I was able to
            recall something learnt earlier and solve a problem by myself. But all in all this has been an immense learning curve. It's quite a 
            challenge to get my head around JavaScript and almost every task required some form of external help. My main strategies 
            where pseudocoding (tho significantly less elegant than what it could look like), simply trying something and either console
            logging or reading error messages (which is a challenge in itself as I lack the language at this stage to even fully understand
            most of it) and googling (though as with error messages understanding solutions when you're a begginner is somewhat difficult).
        </p>
        <p>    
            That being said, I made it so far and with every day/challenge I feel a little bit more able to read code, understand where 
            I went wrong, how to look for help and so on - challenges and struggles are great for learning. And hindsight is awesome too...

        <h4>What's the meaning of:</h4>
        <p>
            <b>.map():</b> changes the elements of an array and then creates a new array with the changed elements
        <p>
            <b>.filter():</b> returns elements from an array that fulfil a condition (evaluate to truthy) written within
            the block of the method (e.g. return only words of a certain length, or only numbers that are < 10 ...)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>.reduce():</b> applies a function against an accumulator and each value of an array (left to right) to reduce
            it to a single value
