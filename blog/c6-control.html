                <h4>When programming, what are some of my triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
                <p>At this stage it is either getting stuck when not understanding what I'm being asked to do (mainly resulting from
                    not understanding the lingo), when I understand the question but cannot figure out what to do or when I think I have 
                    finally figured it out and ... nada.
                </p>
                <p>That being said, I wouldn't say it causes a disproportionate emotional response. I'm only 3 weeks into this course without 
                    any previous experience, so I'm not surprised by running into roadblocks. I mean this is quite a normal learning process/experience
                    so I'm not too worried.

                <h4>How did I find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
                <p>
                    I expect this will be a really handy tool once we hit bootcamp. Especially the breathing part is good advice. And just to be a nerd:
                    breathing calmly calms the amygdala (because you can't breath calmly when you're amygdala is panicking), and a calm brain is the perfect
                    basis for creative thinking, engagement and learning. So yeah, deep breaths.
