            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is used to program the behaviour of web pages. Going back to the earlier house 
                    analogy of HTML being the structure of a house and CSS being in charge of the design and 
                    layout, theni its inhabitants would be JavaScript, that is able to take commands like "get 
                    up", or "if this - do that".
                </p> 
                <h4>What are control flow and loops?</h4>
                <p>Control flow is the order in which statements or functions are executed. A real life example 
                    would be that I need to wake up first in order to have a shower, then have breakfast, and so on until 
                    I go to sleep at night. Somewhere in amongst this flow I would also have to check which day of the week it
                    is as that could change the flow of that day.
                </p>
                <p>Loops are a way to repeat certain instructions over and over again - either for a known amount 
                    of time (for), or an unkown amount of time (while) - until a task is completed. A real life terms loop
                    could be a while loop for riding your bike. While you are riding your bike - pedal as hard as you can. 
                    When the while condition isn't met anymore (stop at an intersection) - don't pedal!
                </p>
                <h4>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?</h4>
                <p>
                    Data from arrays gets indexed starting at 0. In order to access data you simply have to call it by its index.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data in objects gets stored in 'key-value pairs', which means the particular key has to be called to access its value.
                </p>
                <h4>What are functions and why are they useful?</h4>
                <p> 
                    Functions are a way of grouping together several operations in function blocks. Functions are useful because they are 
                    reusable, which means we don't have to write the same code over and over again, but instead just re-use the function.
