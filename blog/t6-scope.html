                <h4>What is Scope and how does it work in JavaScript?</h4>  
                <p>
                    There are two types of scope in JavaScript which determine how variables can be accessed: 
                </p>
                <P>    
                    <b>global scope</b>: variables that are declared outside of functions. They can be accessed from anywhere by any function or script within the code.<br>
                    <b>local scope</b>: variables that are being declared inside a function. They can only be accessed within this function. 
                    What this means is that there can be more than one variable with the same name - as long as they are declared locally (exist
                    only within their respective functions).
