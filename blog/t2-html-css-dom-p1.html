                <h4>An analogy for HTML, CSS and DOM</h4>  
                <p>
                    The house analogy seems really helpful when thinking about this. HTML gives the house structure (website - house; rooms - pages; beds, tables, chairs etc - objects and so on).
                    CSS would be the design of this, how things are decorated and arranged. DOM - well I'm crap when it comes to analogies, but others have described it as a blueprint or project manager and
                    I think that works.

                <h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
                <p>
                    Websites are designed as boxes within boxes within boxes within boxes... It breaks up the design of a whole page into smaller sections. 
                </p>
                <h4>What's the Box Model?</h4>
                <p>
                    The box model refers to the invisible components that make up the size of a box (margins, borders, padding and the actual content).
