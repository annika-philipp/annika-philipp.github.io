        <h2>HTML, CSS and DOM</h2>  
        <p>The house analogy seems really helpful when thinking about this. HTML gives the house structure (website - house; rooms - pages; beds, tables, chairs etc - objects and so on).
           CSS would be the design of this, how things are decorated and arranged. DOM - well I'm crap when it comes to analogies, but others have described is a a blueprint or project manager and
           I think that works.</p>  
        <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2> 
        <p>Websites are designed as boxes within boxes within boxes within boxes... It breaks up the design of a whole page into smaller sections. </p>
        <h2>Box Model</h2>
        <p>The box model refers to the invisible components that make up the size of a box (margins, borders, padding and the actual content). </p>
