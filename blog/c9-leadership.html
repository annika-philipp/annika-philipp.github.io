                <h4>My experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>
                <p>
                    This is an interesting question since for the past 10 years I've been working for a professional development 
                    company with an extremely strong focus on teaching compassionate/empathetic leadership. Having a leader who walks the talk
                    - and obviuosly being deeply involved in this topic through my career - has had an immense input on what I value, how 
                    I treat others and how I want to be treated. From a personal experience I can say that the amount of personal growth and
                    organisational happiness levels are huge. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the flip side, having experienced great leadership trains you to spot terrible or no leadership. I have walked away from 
                    work situations that were unhealthy, largely because I know my values (and one of them is a healthy amount of self resepect).
                    Thinking about what these "leaders" had in common I would definitely say absolute lack of interest in their workforce as human beings,
                    hence no compassion, and certainly no amount of humbleness (as in being interested in other's opinions, being ok with uncertainty, trust etc.).
                </p>
                <h4>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h4>
                <p> 
                    Difficult conversations are difficult, but can be extremely rewarding if they go well. Being aware that there is usually a sub-context of feelings
                    and identity is super important. I would add to the suggested practice that difficult conversations should be announced and preferably
                    with the topic (like "Hey, could we have a chat in the next hour about what happened yesterday?"). That way the other person isn't caught off-guard and
                    immediately on the offense. Also taking a breath of two before responding can be really helpful to look at the conversation in a more detached way instead
                    of just reacting on impulse.
                </p>
                <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes, this book and I...we just didn't really work out. I'd like to say it's me, but ... I'm finding some parts of the 
                    book really non-reflective and questionable. Maybe this stems from years of researching these topics but I keep yelling at 
                    the book to finally start talking about BOUNDARIES! I agree with the overall sentiment of the book (and it is a great intro to 
                    mindfulness), but life (be that private or work) is not always as simple/simplistic as the book makes out. There are situations when it's sure nice to see the good in 
                    a person, but if that person is 99% not good (I did write something else here before), then loving kindness meditation and multiplying 
                    goodness visualisations are not what you want to do. <b>Especially as a woman!</b> Yes, of course seeing the good as opposed to 
                    having preconceived ideas is really valuable, but it can also be exploited (especially in work situations).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This part in particular did not do it for me: <br>
                    "When you instinctively and habitually want to deliver goodness to the world,
                    pretty soon, you become the person who always wants to help others. Eventually, you become one whom people respect, sometimes 
                    even admire, because they feel your heart is in the right place.‚Äù</p>
                <p>
                    NO! NO! NO! This is unreflective! Of course helping is great, but the way this is written is as if you will only get people's 
                    respect and admiration if you help others (helper syndrome here we come). It also turns helping from a selfless act into one 
                    that you do because you expect an outcome (respect in this case). Or what if you (or your boss or co-worker) lack humbleness 
                    and self-awareness and your /their helping is a cloaked form of patronising?
                </p>     
                <p>
                    Of course there are times when helping is anything else but selfless (I help you so we get the job done on time), and that's 
                    fine. But then acknowledge that that's what it is and don't hide it behind it being done to deliver goodness to the world. 
                    Nor is it always advisable to help others without setting boundaries (otherwise you're risking being taken advantage of - and 
                    let's face it, if you're a woman reading this, or any minority who happens to not be a white male, then this warning won't be 
                    news to you).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you've made it this far, I am ranting at something that I feel is missing in the book. Helping is important! Being an 
                    empathetic person is important! So are being kind, and listening, and aware of yourself and others and many other traits. But set 
                    boundaries! People will also respect you for knowing your own worth and for expressing it!
