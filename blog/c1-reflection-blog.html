        <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience and what are your impressions?</h4>
        <p>
          I think this is quite a 'progressive' learning experience - or maybe just the common sense learning we seem to have 
          ignored over the last few decades in education. The focus on soft skills reminds me strongly of Dan Goleman's leadership styles.
          The idea of all of us being in this together (students and teachers) and EDA as a continuously growing project really calls for agency
          - which is super exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also going to be a very intensive and fast paced experience - one I'd definitely want to do with a team instead of on my own!
        </p>       
        <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
        <p> 
          I like the notion that "everyone has a lot to learn and a lot to offer". Remembering this and acting on it will be important: not being 
          afraid to ask questions, while also persisting with difficulty and playing with the tools we are given to create our own learning successes.
          I am not coming into this experience with a lot of previous coding knowledge, but I know a lot about adult learning, mindsets and soft skills,
          I've got an analytical mind, I can (or at least hope I can) look at problems abstractly and come up with creative solutions.  And just like me, 
          others will bring their own skills and experiences to the table so that we will complement each other.
          But also 'small' gestures like ecouraging others and celebrating each other's success will contribute to this culture. 
        </p>
        <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
        <p>
          No, they haven't. I have very high expectations of EDA, just as EDA has of us. All this feeds back into the culture of this place - and was
          a big part in my decision to enrol here.
        </p>
        <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
        <p>
          I am super excited with a healthy dose of nervousness. The learning curve will be immense and seeing some of the work others who are in phase0
          have created so far leaves me blown away. At the same time, knowing that I will be able to build similar projects in a short time as well is a 
          big motivation.
