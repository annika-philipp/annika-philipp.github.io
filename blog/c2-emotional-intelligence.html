                <h4>What learnings did I take from Search Inside Yourself?</h4> 
                <p>
                    All of the topics mentioned in this chapter have been part of my professional work over the 
                    last few years, so emotional intelligence, neuroplasticity/neurology, leadership and 
                    mindfulness aren’t new topics for me. I liked how the author highlighted the fact that 
                    emotional intelligence is not an innate ability but a learned skill (although some people 
                    tend to naturally already have a greater awareness of this than others). On a personal level, 
                    having been exposed to these theories for quite some time, I am reminded of how emotional 
                    intelligence is an ongoing project, sometimes I am better at managing my emotions than at other 
                    times, sometimes my awareness of stress (or equally happiness) factors is better tuned than others.

                <h4>Two minutes of mindfulness</h4> 
                <p> 
                    This is something I’ve struggled with in the past, but in the spirit of making tiny changes, 
                    something I am going to give a shot for the next wee while. I’ve always found running and 
                    solely focussing on my breath easier than sitting still and calming my thoughts. 2 minutes should 
                    be doable though…
