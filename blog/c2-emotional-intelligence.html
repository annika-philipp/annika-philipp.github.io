        <h2>What learnings did I take from Search Inside Yourself?</h2> 
        <p>All of the topics mentioned in this chapter have been part of my professional work over the 
           last few years, so emotional intelligence, neuroplasticity/neurology, leadership and 
           mindfulness aren’t new topics for me. I liked how the author highlighted the fact that 
           emotional intelligence is not an innate ability but a learned skill (although some people 
           tend to naturally already have a greater awareness of this than others). On a personal level, 
           having been exposed to these theories for quite some time, I am reminded of how emotional 
           intelligence is an ongoing project, sometimes I am better at managing my emotions than at other 
           times, sometimes my awareness of stress (or equally happiness) factors is better tuned than others.

        <h2>Two minutes of mindfulness</h2> 
        <p>This is something I’ve struggled with in the past, but in the spirit of making tiny changes, 
            something I am going to give a shot for the next wee while. I’ve always found running and 
            solely focussing on my breath easier than sitting still and calming my thoughts. 2 minutes should 
            be doable though…
