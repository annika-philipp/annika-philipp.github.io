        <h2>Time and Habits</h2>    
        <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
        <p>In terms of habits, coming from a professional development background I've always been a big believer in Carol Dweck's work on mindsets, Csikszentmihalyi's 
            concept of 'Flow' and the importance of celebrating success (be it tiny changes or achieving an end-product).
            Regarding time and organising time, I've timeboxed before albeit with varying degrees of success. 
        </p>
            </p>
        <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2> 
        <p>I like the idea that changing actions can lead to forming new habits and attitudes (Charles Duhigg), and there is a lot
            of research out there that proves the 'fake it till you make it' view (the positive stuff obviously!). It ties in neatly with a growth mindset view and ideas on flow that
            you can achieve a whole lot by the view you adopt of yourself as a learner, simply doing it, and ideally in a space where you feel challenged yet energised.</p>
            <p>After completing the first few tasks of this programme I am also going to tackle my perfectionist mindset and will be reminding myself of mvp and that - accumulated - tiny changes matter. 
                This blog is a pretty good example of this, by far not what I would like it to look like, "yet" (that's Carol Dweck right there). </p>
        </p>
        <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
        <p>I have started applying the pomodoro method, although in a personalised way. Since most tasks are new to me, I am not yet able
            to predict how much time I should allocate to each one, but the overall concept is still applicable. I schedule in breaks, which already breaks the bigger tasks at hand into smaller chunks (very helpful) 
            and unless I'm in a state of 'flow' I then really do take a break. I make sure I get away from my computer (change my environment) to make it an 'actual' break. There is definitely some mindfulness in here too,
            as I focus on enjoying this short break as a break and not just 5 minutes in which I could do the dishes, read emails etc. </p>
            <p>I am also making sure that study time is really that: study time. I am not checking emails regarding my contract work, news pages or social media during that time.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
        <p>We're early on in this project, so for now I will stick with the above (clearly allocated time for work, study, breaks and spare time) to avoid blurring of boundaries
            and what then feels like one part dominating my days.</p> 
            <p>I will try working in a few different environments over the next few weeks to see how that might impact on my ability to focus and get stuff done.</p>
