        <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
        <p> 
          In terms of habits, coming from a professional development background I've always been a big believer in Carol Dweck's work on mindsets, Csikszentmihalyi's 
          concept of 'Flow' and the importance of celebrating success (be it tiny changes or achieving an end-product).
          Regarding time and organising time, I've timeboxed before albeit with varying degrees of success. 
        </p>
        <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4> 
        <p> 
          I like the idea that changing actions can lead to forming new habits and attitudes (Charles Duhigg), and there is a lot
          of research out there that proves the 'fake it till you make it' view (the positive stuff obviously!). It ties in neatly with a growth mindset view and ideas on flow that
          you can achieve a whole lot by the view you adopt of yourself as a learner, simply doing it, and ideally in a space where you feel challenged yet energised.
        </p>
        <p> 
          After completing the first few tasks of this programme I am also going to tackle my perfectionist mindset and will be reminding myself of mvp and that - accumulated - tiny changes matter. 
          This blog is a pretty good example of this, by far not what I would like it to look like, "yet" (that's Carol Dweck right there). 
        </p>
        <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
        <p> 
          I have started applying the pomodoro method, although in a personalised way. Since most tasks are new to me, I am not yet able
          to predict how much time I should allocate to each one, but the overall concept is still applicable. I schedule in breaks, which already breaks the bigger tasks at hand into smaller chunks (very helpful) 
          and unless I'm in a state of 'flow' I then really do take a break. I make sure I get away from my computer (change my environment) to make it an 'actual' break. There is definitely some mindfulness in here too,
          as I focus on enjoying this short break as a break and not just 5 minutes in which I could do the dishes, read emails etc. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          I am also making sure that study time is really that: study time. I am not checking emails regarding my contract work, news pages or social media during that time.
        </p>
        <h4>Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
        <p>
          We're early on in this project, so for now I will stick with the above (clearly allocated time for work, study, breaks and spare time) to avoid blurring of boundaries
          and what then feels like one part dominating my days.
        </p> 
        <p>
          I will try working in a few different environments over the next few weeks to see how that might impact on my ability to focus and get stuff done.
