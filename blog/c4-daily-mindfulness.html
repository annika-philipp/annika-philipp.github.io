                <h4>What did I learn from my 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>  
                <p>It felt somewhat odd having to fill a certain amount of time just talking when I actaully felt like
                    getting some feedback from the other person, having my own words then fed back and rephrased through her 
                    words was quite interesting and somehwat insightful. We both found it hard to fully remember everything. While this
                    wouldn't be my preferred style of communicating in everyday life, I found this to be a really useful
                    technique in conflict-resolution situations in workplaces.
                </p>  
                <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will I use to sustain my practice?</h4>
                <p>I already have a friend who is a sounding board when it comes to mindful insights so that ticks 
                    the 'have a buddy' box. Do less than you can sounds great and definitely doable, and could be my lame 
                    excuse for when I forget to take my one mindful breath a day.
