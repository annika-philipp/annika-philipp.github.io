                <h4>Trust, Sincerity and Empathy</h4>
                <p>
                    To me, trust, sincerety and empathy are really important, but I've got to be honest, this book
                    isn't really for me. I know what its message is, but there are parts of it that don't sit right with
                    me and I'm hoping that by chapter 8 it will finally start talking about how important boundary setting is, that
                    there are structural (or interpersonal) barriers to situations and just throwing love and kindness at a situation can 
                    prevent you from getting out of potentially toxic situations. I'm clearly ranting now!...
                </p>
                <p> 
                    For the sake of doing it I did the loving kindness meditation and the thought of the person I visualised
                    brought a smile to my face. Just reading through the statements (step two of this meditation) made sure all 
                    positive feelings disappeared within seconds though. I'm probably more or an action person when it comes to 
                    kindness, so instead of just thinking kind thoughts about someone, I rather do something to act on the feeling.   
                </p>
                <h4>Political awareness exercise</h4>
                <p>
                    I can remember situations while working in hospo. Time that is not filled with serving customers shouldn't be idle time,
                    as there is always something to clean, stock up on or sort. Often I would do this when my boss wasn't around and once
                    finished would take a break (which seemed fair after say 30 minutes of cleaning walls und undersides of tables).
                    8 out of 9 times that moment of my break would be when my boss returned and to him it looked like I was just chatting to 
                    someone or literally doing nothing. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Luckily we were both able to communicate really well and aware enough to know how the other one would perceive
                    this situation. So these situations never really turned into conflict situations.
