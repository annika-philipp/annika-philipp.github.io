          <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
          <p>
            All are important and have their place in the attempt to live a happy life. Personally I'd say everything
            in balance. Ideally all 3 sit closely together by fulfilling my underlying values and interests. 
          </p>
          <h4>What are my core values and what do I stand for?</h4>
          <p>
            My personal core values would include, family and friends, access to nature, healthy mind and body, freedom of time and
            trust in my own self (resilience).
          </p>
          <p> 
            In a wider sense I value/stand for social justice, life-long learning, enabling others, reciprocity and sustainability.
          </p>
          <h4>How did I find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
          <p>
            Being resilient is a disposition that's really important to me and that I've practiced for quite some time (I guess initially
            uknowingly and later purposefully). I did not end up doing the meditation exercise, meditation just isn't my thing. Also, I'm pretty
            good at letting go, so I found myself artificially creating tensions when thinking about a negative experience when really there were none - 
            at which stage I decided to just not do the meditation.
          </p>
          <p>    
            To me negative experiences obviously suck, but they are when real learning happens and where most of my strength and personal growth 
            comes from (oh hi, resilience definition), which is probably why they don't linger too long as emotions in my memory.
