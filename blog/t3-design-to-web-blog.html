                <h4>What is a responsive site and why is responsiveness important?</h4>  
                <p>
                    A responsive site is designed with the multitude of devices people use to look at website in mind. Different devices mean different screen sizes 
                    and a resonsive site keeps that in mind by having images and content adjust to the screen size.
                </p>  
                <h4>What's mobile first design, and why is it important?</h4>
                <p>
                   Linking to the fact that websites are being accessed through differnt devices, using a mobile first design means designing the page with the smallest
                   screen in mind and making sure the layout works for small screens, then working up from there. 
                </p>
                <h4>What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons?</h4>
                <p>
                    Frameworks, like Skeleton which I've used here, provide a set range of tools and features to easily create a website and can make building a site 
                    really time efficient, plus it's for free and who doesn't like a bargain. A con is that there are limits to what a framework offers and that it can 
                    be tempting to simply apply the framework without at least trying to understand the language behind it.
                </p> 
                <h4>What's a wireframe and why do we use it?</h4>
                <p>A wireframe is an initial drawing of a website's and its page's layout. It really helps visualise the strcture of the page that's being build and serves
                    as a reference point when designing the page.
                </p>
                <p> These are my sketches when I thought about what I wanted this site to look like:
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="three columns">
                            <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" class="t3" alt="index page desktop">
                        </div>
                        <div class="three columns">
                            <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" class="t3" alt="index page mobile">   
                        </div>
                        <div class="three columns">
                            <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" class="t3" alt="blog page desktop">    
                        </div>
                        <div class="three columns">
                            <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" class="t3" alt="blog page mobile">    
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4>Which aspects of my wireframes did I find difficult to implement, and why?</h4>
                <p>IMAGES! Positioning them, getting them to move the way I would like them to, there is still a bit of learning happening on that front.
