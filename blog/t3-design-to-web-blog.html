        <h4>What is a responsive site and why is responsiveness important?</h4>  
        <p>
            A responsive site is designed with the multitude of devices people use to look at website in mind. Different devices mean different screen sizes 
            and a resonsive site keeps that in mind by having images and content adjust to the screen size.
        </p>  
        <h4>What's mobile first design, and why is it important?</h4>
        <p>
            Linking to the fact that websites are being accessed through differnt devices, using a mobile first design means designing the page with the smallest
           screen in mind and making sure the layout works for small screens, then working up from there. 
        </p>
        <h4>What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons?</h4>
        <p>
            Frameworks, like Skeleton which I've used here, provide a set range of tools and features to easily create a website and can make building a site 
            really time efficient, plus it's for free and who doesn't like a bargain. A con is that there are limits to what a framework offers and that it can 
            be tempting to simply apply the framework without at least trying to understand the language behind it.
        </p> 
        <h4>What's a wireframe and why do we use it?</h4>
        <p>A wireframe is an initial drawing of a website's and its page's layout. It really helps visualise the strcture of the page that's being build and serves
            as a reference point when designing the page.
        </p>
        <h4>Which aspects of my wireframes did I find difficult to implement, and why?</h4>
        <p>
            IMAGES! Positioning them, getting them to move the way I would like them to, there is still a bit of learning happening on that front.
