                <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way I tackled the site redesign and rebuild</h4>
                <p>
                    It had a huge impact on how I approached this challenge. For a start I was confident that this week's learning 
                    had given me the tools and resources to do this redesign/rebuild. I started this project in a very structured way, 
                    spending quite a bit of time thinking and hand drawing/writing before actually coding. I kept repeating 
                    ‘process over product’ like a mantra in my head, and it really helped me to focus on what was important and not get 
                    carried away choosing colours, fonts, font sizes, the perfect sizing etc.

                <ul>
                    <li>Does this website look exactly like 'perfectionist-me' would like it to look like? <strong>No!</strong> </li>
                    <li>Am I a graphic designer? <strong>No!</strong></li>
                    <li>So does it matter for this week's task? <strong>No!</strong></li> 
                    <li>Did I achieve the functionality and layout I had in mind though? <strong>Yes!</strong></li> 
                </ul>
                <h4>What did I think about meditation before reading chapter 2</h4>
                <p>
                    I have researched and used the concept of meditation a lot in my current job so know a fair bit about its effects on 
                    the brain and people's lives in general. However, I've always struggled to meditate myself, probably because I like 
                    to be active, am always busy and get a lot of wandering thoughts when I do try.
                </p>
                <h4>What new things have I learnt about meditation?</h4>
                <p> 
                    That I can be okay with wandering thoughts. I am training my brain each time I become aware that my mind wanders and then 
                    refocus my attention. So in the spirit of process over product, I'll persevere with meditation, starting with just a few 
                    minutes, but aiming to eventually increase this.
