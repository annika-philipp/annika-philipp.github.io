        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p>
            What is Scope and how does it work in JavaScript? There are two types of scope in JavaScript which determine 
            how variables can be accessed: global scope: variables that are declared outside of functions. They can be 
            accessed from anywhere by any function or script within the code. local scope: variables that are being declared 
            inside a function.

          pushed to GitHub - and nothing happened. No update. Nothing. I kept hitting the refresh button (more and more vigorously),
           cursing the slow internet (because if in doubt look for the fault in anything but your own actions right?).

        <h4>JavaScript Basics</h4>
        <p>
            How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS? JavaScript is used to program the behaviour of web pages. Going back to the 
            earlier house analogy of HTML being the structure of a house and CSS being in charge of the design and layout, then its 
            inhabitants would be JavaScript, that is being able to take commands like "get up", or "if this - do that".

                What is a responsive site and why is responsiveness important? A responsive site is designed with the multitude of 
                devices people use to look at website in mind. Different devices mean different screen sizes and a resonsive site 
                keeps that in mind by having images and content adjust to the screen size.

            <p>
               The house analogy seems really helpful when thinking about how html, css and the DOM interact. HTML gives the house structure (house - website; rooms - pages; 
               beds, tables, chairs etc - objects and so on). CSS would be the design of this, how things are decorated and arranged. DOM - 
               well I'm crap when it comes to analogies, but others have described it as a blueprint or project manager and I think that works.

          <h4>Leadership</h4>
          <p>
            My experience of compassionate (or not) leadership? This is an interesting question since for the past 10 years 
            I've been working for a professional development company with an extremely strong focus on teaching compassionate/empathetic 
            leadership. Having a leader who walks the talk has had an immense input on what I value, how I treat others and how I want to be treated.

          <p>
            To me, trust, sincerety and empathy are really important, but I've got to be honest, this book ('Search Inside Yourself')
            isn't really for me. I know what its message is, but there are parts of it that don't sit right with me and I'm hoping that 
            by chapter 8 it will finally start talking about how important boundary setting is and that there are structural (or interpersonal) 
            barriers to situations.

            How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens? All are important and have their place 
            in the attempt to live a happy life. Personally, I'd say 'everything in balance'. Ideally all 3 sit closely 
            together and help to fulfil my underlying values and interests. What are my core values and what do I stand for?

            When programming, what are some of my triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?
            At this stage it's either getting stuck when not understanding what I'm being asked to do (mainly 
            resulting from not understanding the lingo), when I understand the question but cannot figure out what 
            to do or when I think I have finally figured it out and ... nada.

              <p>
                 Self awareness and mindfulness are quite similar in the sense that both allow us to reflect on or take note off our 
                 emotions, mental and/or physical state in the present moment. Both are done in a non-judgemental/neutral way and both 
                 are learnable and definitely get easier the more we practice.

                  words then fed back and rephrased through her words was quite interesting and somehwat insightful.

              <p>
                  How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way I tackled the site redesign and rebuild? It had a huge impact.
                  I was confident that this week's learning had given me the tools and resources to do this redesign/rebuild. I started
                  in a very structured way, spending quite a bit of time thinking and hand drawing/writing before actually coding.

                All of the topics mentioned in this chapter in 'Search Inside Yourself' have been part of my professional work over the last few years, 
                so emotional intelligence, neuroplasticity/neurology, leadership and mindfulness aren’t new topics for me. I liked how the author highlighted 
                the fact that emotional intelligence is not an innate ability but a learned skill.

                  In terms of habits, coming from a professional development background I've always been a big believer in Carol Dweck's work on mindsets, 
                  Csikszentmihalyi's concept of 'Flow' and the importance of celebrating success (be it tiny changes or achieving an end-product). Regarding 
                  time and organising time, I've timeboxed before albeit with varying degrees of success.
